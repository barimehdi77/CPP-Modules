About 42 School
42 is an innovative software engineering school that offers multiple computer programming,
coding, and software engineering programs for free. Their goal is to provide access to education,
change diversity in the workforce, eliminate student loan debt, and create real pathways to the workforce.

42 trains students for the digital world, asking that they arrive with 21st-century skills and are prepared
for today's workplace. 42 uses a project-based and problem-based learning along with peer-correction (like code review)
to foster a tight-knit learning environment. Students learn soft skills, creativity, problem-solving, collaboration,
communication, and how to work in teams. They have to give and receive correction, defend their code, and adhere to norms.

At 42 students control what, how, and when they learn, as well as select their own experience points, levels, and
correction points. Curriculum is mastery-based, meaning that students don't advance to the next level until they've
displayed mastery of the current level's skillset.
